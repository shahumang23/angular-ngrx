# Sample

## Exercise

To complete this exercise, I expect you to use ngrx to manage loading data from the config/forex.json file.
The data will be viewed in two views, using the forex-list and forex-detail components.

## Forex List

Present a paged table of foreign exchange data from forex. The table will display the time of the exchange item,
along with the open and close values. The time entry will be sortable.

Note: The date and time must be treated as a standard date. I will be changing locales to see the times in different timezones.

## Forex detail

The stock detail will show the high, low, open and close for a selected forex entry.

## Forex dashboard

There is a third component; a forex dashboard. This will be a separate page in the view under /dashboard.
The dashboard will display a chart displaying the high and low for each entry. I leave it to you to decide
which chart component to use, and which type of chart.
